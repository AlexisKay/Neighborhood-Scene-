12/1 FINAL COMMENTS: 

This project is meant to be a scene best viewed from a first person point of view. This scence resembles a 
video game map "Nuketown" with multiple details in the house structures and layouts. The lighting in this scene 
moves around with the ability to stop/turn off the lighting.  

From the beginning, I wanted this project to be something ambitious that I believed myself to be able to
achieve, however given the comments throughout the project stages and my own personal/academic time 
contraints it definately was lowered to more realistic standards. I included more details and corrected textures/lighting
to my best ability and I believe I was able to showcase the concepts of this class. I wish to continue to learn and 
work on this scene in the future and create the scene I was initially going for. 




11/28 INITIAL COMMENTS: 
I took the comments given by the proposal and decided to not do the explosion as originally proposed
due to time and unnecessary struggles due to something overly ambitious. I decided to remain with 
the Nuketown scene and created it similar to the map on Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. I am attempting to 
make it close to the original map. I have gotten a few details already on the scene with more to come. 

I have the main scene finished with a few details that are needed to be fixed and plan to add more detail 
and create an interesting first person expierience to the best of my ablity. If time allows, 
I am going to try to load objs to add a little bit more fun to the scene but this will not be 
done until I can correctly fix the lighting as it is a mess (as seen in this sumbission) and 
add more details.

There is a lot for me to alter due to textures/stretching/lighting. The lighting currently moves in order 
for normals to be corrected.
